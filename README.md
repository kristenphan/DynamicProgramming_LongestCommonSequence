__Assignment description:__

Compute the longest common subsequence of two integer sequences of length at most 100.

Given two sequences A=(a1,a2,…,an) and B=(b1,b2,…,bm), find the length of their longest common subsequence, i.e., the largest non-negative integer p such that there exist indices 1≤i1<i2<⋯<ip≤n and 1≤j1<j2<⋯<jp≤m such that ai1=bj1,…,aip=bjp.

The problem has applications in data comparison (e.g., diff utility, merge operation in various version control systems), bioinformatics (finding similarities between genes in various species), and others.
